				<h2>- My interests -</h2>
				<div class="card-light interest">
					<h3>Beauty Lover 💄</h3>
						<p>I have always been interested by <b>cosmetics</b>, as far as I remember. I loved to play with my mom and counsin's products, because of their colors and textures. Growing up, I am finding my essentials and what I really like. However, I am still very curious about <b>fragrances</b>. I have always been sensitive to smells and love to discover the process of production. I think I would have love to become a <b>Nose</b> 👃 if I wasn't working in digital. Indeed, I have <i>a big collection of perfumes!</i></p>

					<h3>Serial Watcher 💻</h3>
						<p>Series are probably my favorite <u>time killer</u>. I really feel immersed in the ambiance of the scenarios and get attached to the characters. I can spend <b>hours</b> ⌚ watching these, and my big default is that I often don't take the time to finish a serie. I get bored after a few seasons, or find another one that arouse my interest. I also like watching movies, but it catches less my attention. To really appreciate one, I need to be <b>at the theater with a big cup of popcorn!🍿</b></p>

					<h3>Music & Book Lover 🎵</h3>
						<p>When I want to relax, I like to be in my own bubble. I really need some time to be alone and plunge into a book, or focus on an album. Genders are different according to my current mood, but my favorite artists are Ed Sheeran and Imagine Dragons. Over the last few weeks, I discovered Jess Glynne's new album and I really liked it.</p>

				<div class="card-light interest">
					<h3>Alternative medicines 🍃</h3>
						<p>As I grow up, I get more and more interested into well-being, taking care of my body and mind. To do so, I leaned on naturopathy, with the properties of plants, especially on phytotherapy and aromatherapy. More recently, I discovered the benefits of sophrology to deal with my anxiety throughout breathing and relaxation exercises.
